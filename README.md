# My Little Molecules

### Live Build: 
- [https://MyLittleMolecules.com](https://MyLittleMolecules.com)

### Project Description:
- MyLittleMolecules.com is a chemical visualization tool. It is built for university organic chemistry and biochemistry students. As seen below, the user inputs the name of a molecule and the application returns a 2D and 3D rendering of the molecular structure. A few quick facts about the molecule are returned as well, formatted into a table and displayed at the bottom.

The search input is robust. The user can input either a systematic chemical name such as 2-bromobutane or Dihydrogen Monoxide, or use common names such as water, sugar, vanilla, vinegar, etc...

The application is mobile friendly, allowing students to carry their little molecules around in their little pockets.
